Book App
This repository contains everything I've learned about Express.js and MongoDB. The Book App is a simple application where you can add, delete, or edit a collection of books you've read. It is built using the Express generator and utilizes MongoDB as the database.

Features
Add Books: Easily add new books to your collection.
Edit Books: Update the details of books you've already added.
Delete Books: Remove books from your collection when you no longer want them listed.
Technologies Used
Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js, designed for building web applications and APIs.
MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing the book data.
Express Generator: A tool used to quickly create an application skeleton for an Express project.
