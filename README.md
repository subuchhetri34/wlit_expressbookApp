<h3>Features</h3>
Add Books: Easily add new books to your collection.<br>
Edit Books: Update the details of books you've already added.<br>
Delete Books: Remove books from your collection when you no longer want them listed.
<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js, designed for building web applications and APIs.<br>
MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing the book data.<br>
Express Generator: A tool used to quickly create an application skeleton for an Express project.
